## Seneca Test Task
This is the test assignment for Seneca - a responsive Toggle component:

Try out the completed app here:

## Assumptions and Limitations
- See the `data/questions.json` folder for the list of questions, and the format the data should be in.
- The component is reusable and extendable to any number of questions, with any number of toggles, with two, three, or more options.
- The component is responsive. When you're resizing the browser window to check for responsiveness, you need to refresh the page (it will never be an issue for the end user, but it is required for the questions to display correctly).
- The questions can take on 3 background colors - incorrect, partially correct, and completely correct, matching the gradients I see in the figma file. If you were looking for a different solution - let me know.
